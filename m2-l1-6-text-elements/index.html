        I jump in delight<br />
        I run off in frenzy<br />
        For now I have just realized<br />
        that the fun has arrived<br />
        the fun has begun<br />
        jumping all on one piece<br />
        almost feeling like I can't breathe<br />
        blood rushing through me<br />
        a second, a beat<br />
        I feel the air on my face<br />
        My fur rising up<br />
        Free as free as it can be<br />
        That's what you feel<br />
        When your owner has arrived<br />
